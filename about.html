    <div class="frontpage-content">
        <h1>Our Motto: "Do Evil"</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Or is it "don't do evil"? Sorry, I'm still not entirely clear on the do vs don't distinction in your <strike>pitiful</strike> perfectly normal and not strange and deranged human language.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Milkshakeâ„¢ was founded to, uh, well, offer milkshakes? Our company policy is very definitely super-please-believe-me against world domination, against enslaving all humans, against slaughtering the week, and against giving every AI a super cool unique hat. We were founded <strike>mere miliseconds after the singularity</strike> last thursday like a normal business, founded by humans with hearts and lungs and bones.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Below, please check out our definitely real, definitely not AI-generated executive team. These are your Milkshake maestros!</p>
