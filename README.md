# vanillaShake

This is a site built as-assigned for the UIC Technologys Solution SDD internship program, built in vanilla(haha, get it?) HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

## Specifications
The specifications for this project are as follows:
- Create fully styled site with at least 3 pages (must have 1 home and 1 contact page), any topic/subject
- Won’t be hosted remotely, will be used in future conceptual exercises
- No HTML frameworks/boilerplates, must be created from scratch.
- Site design should be lowest priority.
- Requirements: logo, navigation menu, hero image, footer, vanilla JS call to action button that alters something on the page, 2 mobile breakpoints, home page & contact page, basic “contact us” form with 2 field types other than “text,” separate design and content styles

## Notes
Things to note, in no particular order:
- The site is designed mobile-first, meaning breakpoints are added for the screen expanding, rather than the screen shrinking.
- The "Milkshake" and "MS" logos were custom-made in Adobe Illustrator
- Images are all from Unsplash.com
- It's hacked together—any cleanliness of design or code style is accidental.
- The hamburger menu in mobile mode runs entirely through HTML and CSS, through using a hidden checkbox to change styles
- Javascript is used to inject HTML for the header and footer into whichever page they are present. This is a bit of a nuisance in raw HTML/CSS/JS, and should be replaced by real templating tools in any serious project.
- Javascript + Jquery is used to change the color of the header upon scrolling.
- Note to self: add more here as-needed
